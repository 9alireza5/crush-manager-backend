# Crush Manager API 💘 
Your romantic database, finally under control.

By: Alireza Vakilbashi
📅 Because tracking feelings is just as important as tracking bugs.

🎯 What is this?
This is a (very serious) RESTful API written in Flask with a MariaDB/MySQL backend, designed to help you:

Remember when you met your crush 💬

Track how hard you’ve fallen 💘

Store their Insta just in case 👀

And... maybe plan a future (or plan to move on) 🤷‍♂️

🧰 Prerequisites
Python 3.7+ 🐍

MariaDB or MySQL running 🐬

A heart that’s been broken just enough to want to document it 💔
